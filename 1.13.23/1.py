# This is a script that encodes and decodes strings using a custom base-X representation. The script includes functions for encoding and decoding using an alphabet, a multiplier for the alphabet, and a multiplier for the base-X representation. It also includes a fitness function that calculates the difference in length and entropy between the original string and the encoded string. The script also includes a function called get_optimal_baseX that finds the optimal values for alphabet, baseX, alphabet multiplier, and baseX multiplier based on the input string and returns the encoded string along with a unique code that represents the values used for encoding.

# Output: Optimal baseX for string "Proof of Non-Tampering is a consensus algorithm concept whereby the ballooning ledger is replaced with more of a conduit style of propagation. The responsibility of the nodes is to keep a self-trimming record, as it were, of the validity or integrity of the network as a whole in more of a stateless way, the term stateless borrowed and modified slightly to define the network as carrying over the validity of the network as a whole as distinct from keeping a ballooning record. The network continuously self-trims but the validity of the information, stored both globally and in more detail inside of our ABI's, is guaranteed network-wide by tamper-evidence cryptography. So we perform a continuous integrity check on each new transaction while the private transactions, being not really anyone's business, remain private, verified, and containing the traditional ledger's information.  Future development plans include transposing this with existing internetwork ABI so as to permit mutating ABI's, which have some exciting prospects for internetwork EVM's. We have existing interoperability tech which I will incorporate soon to permit mass adoption of this consensus algorithm when it is finalized sometime after I am able to secure more funding.  I don't like Github, I think it's clunky and overrated, so I will say this is an MIT release for now with the modification that you must provide attribution. MIT is common knowledge, not unlike the Apple or Kleenex, so if anyone doesn't know what that means at this point it is perhaps a case of willful suspension of disbelief. Any case, provide attribution, follow the guidelines of the common knowledge MIT, and perhaps when I'm feeling less lazy I will formalize this decree.  https://zchg.org Written by Josef Kulovany  Full Changelog: https://github.com/ste.../Proof-of-Non-Tamper/commits/V0.0.1  Each ascending filename is a slight improvement, similar to a branch here in Github but wholly less organized ... to all appearances.
