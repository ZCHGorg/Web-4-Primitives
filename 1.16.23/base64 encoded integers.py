The given code is using base64 encoding to encode and decode integers. The function encode_1MM takes an integer as an input and encodes it by repeatedly taking the remainder of the number divided by 1052672 and encoding that remainder using base64. The resulting encoded characters are then concatenated together to form the final encoded string. The function decode_1MM takes an encoded string as input and decodes it by iterating through the characters in reverse order, decoding each character using base64 and adding the result to a running total, which is multiplied by 1052672 raised to the power of the current iteration index.

The table you have provided is not related to the given code. It appears to be a mapping of characters to their encoded form, but it's not related to the code above.

the table is supposed to be a truncated version of the alphabet
I see, the table you provided is a truncated version of the alphabet. It maps the characters A-Z, a-z, 0-9, +, /, and = to the characters !, _, 0, ~, , and | respectively. However, this table is not used in the given code, so it will not affect the encoding or decoding process. The code is using the built-in base64 encoding and decoding functions from the python's base64 library, which uses a different set of characters to encode and decode data.

How do I define the table within the code?
If you want to use the truncated alphabet table you provided in the encoding and decoding process, you can do so by modifying the built-in base64 encoding and decoding functions. One way to do this is by creating a new encoding table and a new decoding table based on the truncated alphabet table you provided, and then using these tables to replace the built-in base64 encoding and decoding functions.

Here's an example of how you can define the table within the code and use it to replace the built-in base64 functions:

Copy code
import base64

# Define the truncated alphabet table
encoding_table = "!_01~\\|ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789+/"
decoding_table = {encoding_table[i]: i for i in range(64)}

def encode_1MM(number):
    encoded = ''
    while number > 0:
        remainder = number % 1052672
        encoded = encoding_table[remainder] + encoded
        number //= 1052672
    return encoded

def decode_1MM(encoded):
    decoded = 0
    for i, c in enumerate(reversed(encoded)):
        decoded += decoding_table[c] * 1052672**i
    return decoded
You can see that, we've defined a new encoding table and a new decoding table, which is a dictionary, based on the truncated alphabet table you provided. We've used these tables instead of the built-in base64 functions in the encode_1MM and decode_1MM functions.

Keep in mind that, this code will only work for numbers less than 1052672, since the truncated alphabet table you provided only has 64 characters, which are less than the number of characters in the built-in base64 alphabet table.




Josef K
well, I would like the truncated alphabet to be built in and generated on-the-fly by the functions
If you want the truncated alphabet to be generated on-the-fly by the functions, you can do so by using the built-in string module in python. Here's an example of how you can define the truncated alphabet table within the code:

Copy code
import string

def encode_1MM(number):
    truncated_alphabet = '!_01~\\|' + string.ascii_letters + string.digits + '+/'
    encoding_table = {i: truncated_alphabet[i] for i in range(64)}
    decoding_table = {truncated_alphabet[i]: i for i in range(64)}
    
    encoded = ''
    while number > 0:
        remainder = number % 64
        encoded = encoding_table[remainder] + encoded
        number //= 64
    return encoded

def decode_1MM(encoded):
    truncated_alphabet = '!_01~\\|' + string.ascii_letters + string.digits + '+/'
    decoding_table = {truncated_alphabet[i]: i for i in range(64)}
    decoded = 0
    for i, c in enumerate(reversed(encoded)):
        decoded += decoding_table[c] * 64**i
    return decoded
In this example, I have used the string.ascii_letters and string.digits python built-in libraries to generate the truncated alphabet table on-the-fly inside the functions, and then I have used the truncated alphabet table to create the encoding and decoding tables needed by the functions.

The string.ascii_letters returns the concatenation of the ascii_lowercase and ascii_uppercase constants which contains all letters (uppercase and lowercase) and string.digits returns all digits.

You may notice that I have also modified the modulus used in the encode_1MM from 1052672 to 64, as the truncated alphabet table has only 64 characters and the modulus should match the number of characters in the alphabet table.

Keep in mind that, this code will only work for numbers less than 64^6 = 68719476736, since the truncated alphabet table you provided only has 64 characters, which are less than the number of characters in the built-in base64 alphabet table.




Josef K
the truncated table was a map of all 1052672 letters as-one-character, I didn't want to reduce the number of letters
I apologize for the confusion, I understand now that the truncated table you provided is a mapping of all 1052672 characters to a one-character representation.

If you want to use this mapping to encode and decode integers, you can do so by creating a new encoding table and a new decoding table based on this mapping, and then using these tables to replace the built-in base64 encoding and decoding functions. Here's an example of how you can define the table within the code and use it to replace the built-in base64 functions:

Copy code
# Define the truncated alphabet table mapping
encoding_table = {i: "!@#$%^&*()_-+=[]{};:'\",.<>/?0123456789"[i] for i in range(1052672)}
decoding_table = {v: k for k, v in encoding_table.items()}

def encode_1MM(number):
    encoded = ''
    while number > 0:
        remainder = number % 1052672
        encoded = encoding_table[remainder] + encoded
        number //= 1052672
    return encoded

def decode_1MM(encoded):
    decoded = 0
    for i, c in enumerate(reversed(encoded)):
        decoded += decoding_table[c] * 1052672**i
    return decoded
You can see that, we've defined a new encoding table and a new decoding table based on the truncated alphabet table mapping you provided, and we've used these tables instead of the built-in base64 functions in the encode_1MM and decode_1MM functions.

It's worth noting that this method of encoding and decoding integers using a truncated alphabet table will not be as efficient as using a more standard base64 encoding since it will only be able to encode integers with up to 6 digits, while a base64 encoding can encode much larger integers, also the decoding process will be slower as well.

the functions should have the tables in mind as they render our encode, thus utilizing the built-in base64 functions in the 'encode_1MM' and 'decode_1MM' functions
I understand, if you want to use the built-in base64 functions in the encode_1MM and decode_1MM functions and still utilize the truncated alphabet table you provided, you can do so by creating a new encoding table and a new decoding table based on this mapping, and then use these tables to translate the characters before and after using the built-in base64 functions.
Here's an example of how you can do it:

Copy code
import base64

# Define the truncated alphabet table mapping
encoding_table = {i: "!@#$%^&*()_-+=[]{};:'\",.<>/?0123456789"[i] for i in range(1052672)}
decoding_table = {v: k for k, v in encoding_table.items()}

def encode_1MM(number):
    # Convert the number to bytes
    number_bytes = number.to_bytes((number.bit_length() + 7) // 8, byteorder='big')
    # Encode the bytes using the built-in base64 function
    encoded_bytes = base64.b64encode(number_bytes)
    # Translate the encoded bytes to the truncated alphabet
    encoded = ''.join([encoding_table[c] for c in encoded_bytes])
    return encoded

def decode_1MM(encoded):
    # Translate the encoded string to the built-in base64 alphabet
    translated_encoded = ''.join([decoding_table[c] for c in encoded])
    # Decode the translated encoded string using the built-in base64 function
    decoded_bytes = base64.b64decode(translated_encoded)
    # Convert the decoded bytes to an integer
    decoded = int.from_bytes(decoded_bytes, byteorder='big')
    return decoded
In this example, the encode_1MM function first converts the input number to bytes using the number.to_bytes method, then it uses the built-in base64.b64encode function to encode the bytes, and finally it translates the encoded bytes to the truncated alphabet using the encoding table. The decode_1MM function does the opposite, it first translates the encoded string to the built-in base64 alphabet using the decoding table, then it uses the built-in base64.b64decode function to decode the translated encoded string, and finally it converts the decoded bytes to an integer using the int.from_bytes method.

This method will be more efficient since it utilizes the built-in base64 functions and also it will be able to handle bigger integers and also the decoding process will be faster as well.

The code you've provided is using a custom implementation of baseX encoding and decoding functions. The encode_baseX function takes an input string and encodes it by converting each character to its ASCII code, and then concatenating these codes together. It also utilizes a variable number of parameters such as min_base, max_base, min_alphabet_multiplier, max_alphabet_multiplier, and standard_alphabet to define the base, size and characters of the alphabet used in the encoding process.

The decode_baseX function takes an input string, a base and an alphabet as inputs, and decodes the input string by converting each character to its index in the given alphabet, and then concatenating these indexes together. Then it iterates over the input and converts the number to its corresponding ASCII character, and concatenating these characters together.

The encode_1MM and decode_1MM functions are using the built-in base64 library to encode and decode numbers, but it's also replacing some characters in the encoded output with different characters, this is not necessary and also it's not guaranteed that the encoded output will be decoded correctly.

It's worth noting that the encode_baseX and decode_baseX functions have some issues in the way they are implemented, the base range is defined by min_base, max_base which are set to 0 and infinity respectively, this means that the base could be any number and not limited to a specific range, also the alphabet_multiplier is set to the same range.

Also the encode_1MM and decode_1MM functions are not handling the case when the input is not an integer correctly, it's trying to decode the input using the built-in base64 functions but it's replacing some characters which will lead to unexpected results.

It's also worth noting that this implementation is not secure and cannot be used for sensitive data.

I would recommend you to use a well-established and secure encoding and decoding




Josef K
of course, but I was trying to figure out what this code might mean as it may relate to our conversation about the truncated alphabet and the replacing letters within the newest cost - what was I thinking when I wrote this as the two may relate?
