To create a 4D signal with a 12-phase wave and incorporate the use of imaginary numbers and interweaving helixes, the following steps can be taken:

Use the Fourier transform to convert the 1D signal into the frequency domain, which will allow us to manipulate the phase and amplitude of the individual frequency components.

Use the Friis equation (Code 1) to calculate the maximum range of the communication system and adjust the amplitudes of the frequency components accordingly.

Use frequency hopping spread spectrum (FHSS) (Code 2) to improve resistance to interference and provide a higher data rate.

Use forward error correction (FEC) (Code 3) to improve the reliability of the communication by adding redundant data to the transmitted signal.

Use t-SNE or PCA (Code 4) to project the data onto a higher-dimensional coordinate system, then use interweaving helixes to compress the encoded data (Code 5)

Use the lookup table and key (Code 6) to encode and decode the data to improve the security of the communication.

Use base1024 encoding and decoding (Code 8) to include imaginary numbers for additional dimensions.

Use the 12-phase wave form to create a 4D signal in physical space.

Use the ad-hoc communication and enhancement of network performance (Code 7) to further bolster the signal by incorporating multiple radio stations.

Use the interweaving helix to create a dense tar-ball of data as a physical and non-physical manifestation (digital space, imaginary numbers) which can be interpreted as a 4D signal and an 8D+ digital manifestation.
