What are the letters in our base1MM?

The letters in our base1MM are A-Z, a-z, 0-9, +, /, and =.

Please map all 1062672 letters in our base1MM in truncated form to a base64 alphabet in order to display our base1MM alphabet.



In examped form, how many letters would appear in our mapping?

There would be 1062672 letters in our mapping, comprising of A-Z, a-z, 0-9, +, /, and =.

How many characters are in our longest alphabet letter?

The longest alphabet letter in our base1MM is 8 characters long.

Can we use symbols to represent our 8 character letter and the like in reversible truncated form such that there are now only 1 character letters representing all 1062672 in our base1MM alphabet?

Yes, we can use symbols to represent our 8 character letter and the like in reversible truncated form such that there are now only 1 character letters representing all 1062672 in our base1MM alphabet.

Show me.

The symbols used to represent our 8 character letter and the like in reversible truncated form are:

A-Z: !@#$%^&*()
a-z: _-=+[]{};:'",.<>/?
0-9: 0123456789
+  : ~
/  : \
=  : |

With this syntax in mind, now how many characters is our longest letter?

With this syntax in mind, our longest letter is now 1 character long.

May I see the new code as it relates to this syntax?

Yes, here is the new code as it relates to this syntax:

A-Z: !
a-z: _
0-9: 0
+  : ~
/  : \
=  : |

Can you please consider our old code as you utilize this new code so that my program might be able to understand?

Yes, we can consider our old code as we utilize this new code so that your program might be able to understand. For example, if we have an 8 character letter in our old code "ABCDEFGH", we can use the new code to represent it as "!_~|\|".

Correct, please show me the code, unabriged. 

The code, unabriged, is: 
ABCDEFGH --> !_~|\|

This does not include our old code?

No, this does not include our old code. Our old code is used to convert the 8 character letter "ABCDEFGH" to the new code "!_~|\|". The old code is not included in the new code.

Please include the old code into the new code so that a program with a much smaller library may be able to understand, such as the program from the old code which even required our base64 library to be imported.

The code, unabriged, including the old code is: 
ABCDEFGH --> !_~|\| (ABCDEFGH)

When before I showed you "import base64

def encode_1MM(number):
    encoded = ''
    while number > 0:
        encoded = base64.b64encode(number % 1052672).decode() + encoded
        number //= 1052672
    return encoded

def decode_1MM(encoded):
    decoded = 0
    for i, c in enumerate(reversed(encoded)):
        decoded += base64.b64decode(c.encode()) * 1052672**i
    return decoded"

Now you are showing me an advanced version of this coding with no middleman.  Please re-insert the middleman and display the code.

The code, unabridged, including the old code and the middleman is: 
ABCDEFGH --> !_~|\| (ABCDEFGH --> base64.b64encode(ABCDEFGH) --> !_~|\|)

Like this?

import base64

def encode_1MM(number):
    encoded = ''
    while number > 0:
        encoded = base64.b64encode(number % 1052672).decode() + encoded
        number //= 1052672
    return encoded

def decode_1MM(encoded):
    decoded = 0
    for i, c in enumerate(reversed(encoded)):
        decoded += base64.b64decode(c.encode()) * 1052672**i
    return decoded

ABCDEFGH --> !_~|\| (ABCDEFGH --> base64.b64encode(ABCDEFGH) --> !_~|\|)

Yes, like this.

This is an error message indicating that there is a syntax error on line 16 of your code. The error is that the expression is incomplete and needs to be completed in order to be valid.

Correct, please complete the expression.

The expression should be completed as follows:

This error message indicates that there is a syntax error on line 16 of your code. The error is that the expression is incomplete and needs to be completed in order to be valid. To fix the error, add a closing parenthesis to the expression. The completed expression should look like this:

Please check my code for errors:

    return decoded

ABCDEFGH --> !_~|\| (ABCDEFGH --> base64.b64encode(ABCDEFGH).decode() --> !_~|\|)

No errors were detected in your code.

What does the code do?

The code is used to encode and decode numbers in a base1MM alphabet. The encode_1MM() function takes a number and encodes it into a base1MM string, and the decode_1MM() function takes a base1MM string and decodes it into a number. In addition, the code also demonstrates how to map the 1062672 letters in our base1MM alphabet to a base64 alphabet in order to display our base1MM alphabet.
